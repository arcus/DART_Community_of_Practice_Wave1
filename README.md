# DART Community of Practice

This repository contains the email templates and community building prompts for the 16 week [DART Program](https://arcus.github.io/education_modules/).

The [syllabus](syllabus.md), shorter [schedule](schedule.md) and [Weekly Emails](Weekly_Emails) are built from the information inside the [Prompts folder](Prompts).

When all links are updated, run the `run_all.sh` script to update the emails, schedule, and syllabus.

## Prompts Structure

Any update to the order or contents of the community of practice prompts should be made in the file containing it in that week's folder under Prompts.

Each week has 5 markdown files describing it. 

NOTE: list formatting in these files must be in html to ensure proper rendering in emails and syllabus.

- `activities.md`
- `discussion_topic.md`
- `extra.md` this file may contain an opportunity to explore further or plan the community, or may be left empty. Formatting should be:
```
**Bolded Title**
Description of the extra activity. So far these are either instructions about planning communication or exploring the week's topic further.
```
- `social_warm_up.md`
- `theme.md` which contains the week's data:
```
program_week:
section: 
section_week: 
topic: 
signature: 
```
Some weeks (6 and 7) have an additional file which will be attached to the email as part of the week's activities.

## Weekly Emails

These weekly emails are generated from the weekly prompts and **should not be edited directly**.

The language in the prompts can be updated in their respective markdown files, and the other text of the emails can be changed in the subfolder [Email_Text](https://github.com/arcus/DART_Community_of_Practice/tree/main/Weekly_Emails/Email_Text).

## Automation and Scripts

Any update to a file in Prompts or Weekly_Emails/Email_Text will trigger a GitHub Action that will rebuild the weekly emails, the schedule, and the syllabus on `push`ing to the repository.

If you want to recreate this automation outside of GitHub, the scripts used are in the scripts folder:

- `syllabus.sh` creates [syllabus.md](syllabus.md) which contains the weekly themes and activities as a table.
- `schedule.sh` creates a shorter list version with links to the prompts folder for each week in [schedule.md](schedule.md)
- `emails.sh` creates the weekly emails
- `run_all.sh` should be run each time a prompt is updated or a section of email text changed.


These scripts should be run from the main `DART_Community_of_Practice` directory.
