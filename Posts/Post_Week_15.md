# **Week 15 Community of Practice Activities:**
Please comment on this post with your response to the week's activities.

### **Activity:** 
Take the Post-Intervetion Survey. You will be getting a link to take this survey in a separate email. Whether you did every module on your pathway, never once interacted with the program, or were somewhere in between, **your survey responses are crucial data for our research!** 

### **Social Warm-Up:** 
Find and post a cartoon that speaks to your experience with the program or with coding so far.

### **Discussion Topic:** 
Reflect on your last 15 weeks as a community. What activities, discussions, or modules were most helpful to you? Have you changed anything about how you do your work over the course of this program? Or how you think about data?
