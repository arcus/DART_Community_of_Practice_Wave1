# **Week 8 Community of Practice Activities:**
Please comment on this post with your response to the week's activities.

### **Activity:** 
This weekâ€™s activity is to fill out the ðŸ”´[mid-program survey](link/to/survey)ðŸ”´. You can fill out the survey either before or after participating in this weekâ€™s discussion. 

### **Social Warm-Up:** 
**Social Warm-Up:** One method programmers use a lot, called "[rubber ducking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)," involves explaining what they are trying to do in plain language to a colleague, or if a colleague is not available, an inanimate object like a rubber duck. What qualities (personality/catchphrase/outfit/etc) would you want your rubber duck to reflect back to you? 

### **Discussion Topic:** 
Reflect on the last few weeks' activities where you were repeatedly asked to try things you didnâ€™t know how to do. 
<ul>
<li> What emotions did you experience while figuring out how to open the mystery file? </li>
<li> What balance (or lack of balance) did you find between the frustrations of getting stuck and the joys of working past that to ultimately open the mystery_file? </li>
<li> Do you have any advice for your community members, or for yourself in the future, when faced with similar challenges? </li>
</ul>

### **Planning:** 
If you want to meet synchronously with members of your Community of Practice during the second half of the program, start to plan that now. What are good times to meet?
