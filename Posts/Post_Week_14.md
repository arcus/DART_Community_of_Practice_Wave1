# **Week 14 Community of Practice Activities:**
Please comment on this post with your response to the week's activities.

### **Activity:** 
Try to create a visualization of some of the data in your dataset from last week.  While not everyone had R or Python in their pathway through the modules, if you did, try to create your visualization using one of those. You will most likely get error messages as you attempt to create a visualization. When you get an error message, share your error message with the group and see if anyone else got stuck at a similar spot.  

### **Social Warm-Up:** 
What have you used in the past to create data visualizations? Are those visualizations easy to make and update? Do they look good and convey information effectively?

### **Discussion Topic:** 
If you are able to create a visualization without encountering any error messages or difficulty running code, post your visualization and code and respond to others' posts about where they got stuck. What was challenging about creating, or attempting to create, your visualization?

### **Explore Further:** 
Different members of your community of practice probably created their visualizations using different programming languages. No programming language is inherently better or worse than any other.
