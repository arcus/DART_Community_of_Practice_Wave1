# **Week 4 Community of Practice Activities:**
Please comment on this post with your response to the week's activities.

### **Activity:** 
How well do you know the new 2023 NIH data sharing rules? Read through the [FAQs](https://sharing.nih.gov/faqs#/data-management-and-sharing-policy.htm) to get an overview of what these new rules mean for you and your work. 

### **Social Warm-Up:** 
Give a six word description of what you do. This could be silly or serious, and certainly won’t be long enough to get into much detail. Examples might be: 
<ul>
    <li> “Teach biomedical researchers to “data” better.” </li>
    <li> “Make mice sick, learn about cancer.” </li>
    <li> “Stain kids to see their organs.” </li>
</ul>

### **Discussion Topic:** 
Pick something new you learned from the NIH data sharing rules and share it with your community of practice. Does your lab have a plan in place? Are there practices that will have to change to comply with these new policies?
