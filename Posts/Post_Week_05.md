# **Week 5 Community of Practice Activities:**
Please comment on this post with your response to the week's activities.

### **Activity:** 
It is extremely common to come across words and acronyms that are brand new to you when learning or practicing data science. Do a web search for something you have come across in a module or in your work that is new to you. If you don't have one handy, try JSON. We are intentionally not giving you any context about "JSON." 

### **Social Warm-Up:** 
What webpage cheat sheets do you keep coming back to? Or do you have any phrases or commands that you do a web search on every time you need to use them?

### **Discussion Topic:** 
There is a lot of information on the internet and web searches can be a very effective way to learn. However different sites and platforms have different tones and expectations. Stack Exchange, for example, has abundant information and a very active community of users answering questions, but can also be an unfriendly place. Think about the search results you got in the activity when discussing the following questions:
<ul>
    <li> What types of answers were most understandable and useful to you? </li>
    <li> Do you have any instructions or guidelines for how to answer programming questions kindly and constructively? </li>
    <li> What style of response makes you feel most comfortable asking your own questions? </li>
</ul>

### **Explore Further:** 
Read this article on Medium about [how to ask for programming help in public forums](https://medium.com/the-self-taught-programmer/as-a-new-programmer-asking-for-help-is-intimidating-5188a0f62ab9). The author is making an effort to be warm and welcoming to new programmers while providing useful advice. Do you find they achieved that goal?
