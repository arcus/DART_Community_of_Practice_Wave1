# **Week 16 Community of Practice Activities:**
Please comment on this post with your response to the week's activities.

### **Activity:** 
Add your recent skills acquisition to your CV.  If you didn't do the ðŸ”´Post-Test SurveyðŸ”´, do it now to get some sample language for your CV! You can also:
<ul>
    <li> Share your materials with the community for constructive feedback, and </li>
    <li> Update your GitHub profile and add README files to projects you have been working on.</li>
</ul> 

### **Social Warm-Up:** 
Share your contact information and ways your community can follow you in the future e.g. [ORCID](https://orcid.org/), social media, etc.

### **Discussion Topic:** 
Would you like to continue this community of practice in some way after the DART Program concludes? If so, now is the time to formulate a plan for ongoing communication.
