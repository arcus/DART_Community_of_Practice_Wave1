</ul> 

### **Social Warm-Up:** 
Share a data visualization you have particularly enjoyed. It might be from a news article, scientific journal, really anywhere as long as it is public. Or share a bad data visualization and explain why it is so bad. Many examples are available at https://badvisualisations.tumblr.com/.
 

### **Discussion Topic:** 
Share a dataset you encountered in this weekâ€™s activity. Where and how did you find it? What makes it particularly interesting or useful to you? Is there anything you are excited to do with this dataset in the future?

### **Explore Further:** 
Search for interesting public datasets on [kaggle.com](kaggle.com), a site with over 50,000 public datasets.
