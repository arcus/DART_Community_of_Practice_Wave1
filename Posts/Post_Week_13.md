# **Week 13 Community of Practice Activities:**
Please comment on this post with your response to the week's activities.

### **Activity:** 
Explore a public data set. You can use yours or someone else's from last week or find a new one, just don't use one from your own research that needs to be kept private because we are asking you to share it. See if you can figure out:
<ol>
    <li> The column or variable names </li>
    <li> The total number of records </li>
    <li> The type of data: is it numerical? Geographical? Human language? A mix of several types? </li>
    <li> If there is missing data, and if so, how much? </li>
</ol> 

### **Social Warm-Up:** 
Share a story of missing or wrong data. It could be something minor, or a major problem like the California man who got the [license plate NULL ](https://www.wired.com/story/null-license-plate-landed-one-hacker-ticket-hell/) for his car.

### **Discussion Topic:** 
Share what you learned about your dataset. What programs, languages, or tools did you use to explore it? Did you get stuck at any point? Were you able to figure out if there was missing data?

### **Explore Further:** 
The questions we asked in this weekâ€™s activity are examples of metadata. Read this short article about [what metadata is and why it is important](https://data.research.cornell.edu/content/writing-metadata).
