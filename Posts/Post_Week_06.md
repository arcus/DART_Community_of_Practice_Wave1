# **Week 6 Community of Practice Activities:**
Please comment on this post with your response to the week's activities.

### **Activity:** 
Attempt to open the [attached mystery file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcus/DART_Community_of_Practice/main/Prompts/Week06/mystery_file) and see what it contains. Does it open when you double click on it? Does right-clicking give you a list of possible applications to open it with? A basic text editor like NotePad (Microsoft) or TextEdit (Apple) will be able to open this file. What, if anything, can you learn from looking at the file? 

### **Social Warm-Up:** 
Describe a time someone helped you get unstuck with your work.

### **Discussion Topic:** 
Describe what feelings you have when you look at this file. Were you able to extract any information at all from it? What would you do if you had to tell someone what this file contains?
