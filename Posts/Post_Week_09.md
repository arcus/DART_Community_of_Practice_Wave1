# **Week 9 Community of Practice Activities:**
Please comment on this post with your response to the week's activities.

### **Activity:** 
Read the article [Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159v2/) by Jenny Bryan. While there may be some sections that don’t apply to you directly (for example if you don’t use R), the overall message is extremely important. 

### **Social Warm-Up:** 
Share the "best" bad file name you have come across (or perhaps used yourself). These might be files like 
<ul>
    <li> probably_important3.doc, </li>
    <li> final_submission_actually_final.pdf, </li> 
    <li> Untitled3523.jpg, etc. </li>
</ul>

### **Discussion Topic:** 
How do you keep track of changes in your files over time? What works well, and what problems have you encountered?
