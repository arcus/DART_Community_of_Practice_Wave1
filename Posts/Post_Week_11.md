# **Week 11 Community of Practice Activities:**
Please comment on this post with your response to the week's activities.

### **Activity:** 
A project is **open source** if all of the code and files used to make it are publicly available and are free from most intellectual property restrictions.  In other words, you can change and reuse open source code in your own project without getting special permission. There are a great many open source projects on GitHub, some maintained by large groups of collaborators. Use [GitHubâ€™s search capabilities](https://github.com/search) - you can search by topic, author, or project name if you happen to know it - to find a repository that is interesting to you.  Read its README file to learn more about it and explore the files it contains. 

### **Social Warm-Up:** 
What is a technical term in your field that sounds like something different (or confusing or weird) to people outside of your subfield or community? For example GitHub users talk about "forking" a repository, which means making a copy of it that they can then use and modify however they like.

### **Discussion Topic:** 
Share a link to the GitHub repository (or **repo**) you found interesting and give a little information about what it contains. Some questions to consider answering include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
    <li> Does it have a license stating that it is open source? What restrictions does it have on its use? </li>
    <li> Does it have code you have used before, or are interested in using in the future?  </li>
    <li> Does it have many maintainers, or just a couple (or one)? </li>
    <li> When was it last updated? Are people actively working on it? </li>
</ul>
