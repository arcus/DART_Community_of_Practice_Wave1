# **Week 10 Community of Practice Activities:**
Please comment on this post with your response to the week's activities.

### **Activity:** 
If you donâ€™t already have one, create a GitHub account at [github.com](github.com). This can be a place for you to put some of your public work as part of your public portfolio. 

### **Social Warm-Up:** 
What is the silliest/weirdest/best user name you have had or seen that you are willing to share? (Keep it work-appropriate, please.)

### **Discussion Topic:** 
Share your GitHub handle with other members of your community of practice. If you have a pre-existing account, tell your community about what you have been using it for, but we expect that most of them will be empty because you just created them this week.
