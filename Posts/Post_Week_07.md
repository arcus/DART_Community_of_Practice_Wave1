# **Week 7 Community of Practice Activities:**
Please comment on this post with your response to the week's activities.

### **Activity:** 
The file we gave you last week isnâ€™t meant to be viewed as a text file, it is actually a geojson file. There are ways to use programming languages like R or Python to open it and get a better idea of what it contains. There are also online tools that will display the data inside it in a more useful way. Use the power of the internet to figure out how to better display [mystery_file.geojson](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcus/DART_Community_of_Practice/main/Prompts/Week07/mystery_file.geojson) and determine what it contains. If you get stuck, ask for help in the community discussion. 

### **Social Warm-Up:** 
Share your favorite (or least favorite, or most common) error message. What do you do when it appears?

### **Discussion Topic:** 
How were you able to open the file? What did it contain? If you got stuck at any point, how did you get past that? When you did open it, did you have any feelings of excitement, accomplishment, or joy?
