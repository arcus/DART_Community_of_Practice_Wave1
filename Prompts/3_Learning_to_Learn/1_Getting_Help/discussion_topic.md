There is a lot of information on the internet and web searches can be a very effective way to learn. However different sites and platforms have different tones and expectations. Stack Exchange, for example, has abundant information and a very active community of users answering questions, but can also be an unfriendly place. Think about the search results you got in the activity when discussing the following questions:
<ul>
    <li> What types of answers were most understandable and useful to you? </li>
    <li> Do you have any instructions or guidelines for how to answer programming questions kindly and constructively? </li>
    <li> What style of response makes you feel most comfortable asking your own questions? </li>
</ul>
