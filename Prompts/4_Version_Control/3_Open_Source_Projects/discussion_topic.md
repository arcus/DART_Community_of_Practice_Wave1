<ul>
    <li> Does it have a license stating that it is open source? What restrictions does it have on its use? </li>
    <li> Does it have code you have used before, or are interested in using in the future?  </li>
    <li> Does it have many maintainers, or just a couple (or one)? </li>
    <li> When was it last updated? Are people actively working on it? </li>
</ul>
