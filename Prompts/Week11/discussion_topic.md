3. **Discussion Topic:** Share a link to the GitHub repository (or **repo**) you found interesting and give a little information about what it contains. Some questions to consider answering include, but are not limited to:
    - Does it have a license stating that it is open source? What restrictions does it have on its use?
    - Does it have code you have used before, or are interested in using in the future? 
    - Does it have many maintainers, or just a couple (or one)?
    - When was it last updated? Are people actively working on it?
