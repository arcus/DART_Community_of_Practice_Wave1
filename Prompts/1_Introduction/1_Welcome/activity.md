Log into [Thinkific](https://dart-program.thinkific.com/) and explore what you find there. Make sure you can do the following two things which are necessary for full participation in the DART program:
<ol>
<li> Locate your pathway of learning modules and try out the first module on your pathway.</li>
<li> Locate your Community of Practiceâ€™s PeerBoard and read the [community guidelines](https://dart-program.thinkific.com/pages/communities-of-practice?path=post--1501091728). This is where you will be having discussions with your community of practice and sharing your responses to the social warm-ups.
</li>
</ol>
