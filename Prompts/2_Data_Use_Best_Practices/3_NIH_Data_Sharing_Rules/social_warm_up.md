Give a six word description of what you do. This could be silly or serious, and certainly won’t be long enough to get into much detail. Examples might be: 
<ul>
    <li> “Teach biomedical researchers to “data” better.” </li>
    <li> “Make mice sick, learn about cancer.” </li>
    <li> “Stain kids to see their organs.” </li>
</ul>
