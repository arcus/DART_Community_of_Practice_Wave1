**Activity:** Explore a public data set. You can use yours or someone else's from last week or find a new one, just don't use one from your own research that needs to be kept private because we are asking you to share it. See if you can figure out:
- The column or variable names
- The total number of records
- The type of data: is it numerical? Geographical? Human language? A mix of several types?
- If there is missing data, and if so, how much?
