**Welcome to Week @week of the DART Program!**

Please take a moment to look at this weekâ€™s activities and set aside 2 or 3 hours in your week to work on the modules in your pathway and participate in your Community of Practice. 

This week is **@section Part @section_week: @topic**

Week @week Community of Practice Activities:

1. Week@week/activity.md
2. Week@week/social_warm_up.md
3. Week@week/discussion_topic.md
4. Week@week/extra.md

**When to post:**

While we are specifically asking you to post both your social warm-up and discussion, you can and should also post about other things!

Any time you get stuck or unstuck, consider posting about it in your Community of Practice. Your peers can empathize with you, help you get unstuck, benefit from what you have already learned, and celebrate your accomplishments with you!
