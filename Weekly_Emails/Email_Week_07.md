**Welcome to Week 7 of the DART Program!**

Please take a moment to look at this week’s activities and set aside 2 to 3 hours in your week to work on the modules in your pathway and participate in your Community of Practice. 

This week is **Learning How to Learn Data Science Part 3: Getting Unstuck**.

**Week 7 Community of Practice Activities:**

**Activity:** 
The file we gave you last week isn’t meant to be viewed as a text file, it is actually a geojson file. There are ways to use programming languages like R or Python to open it and get a better idea of what it contains. There are also online tools that will display the data inside it in a more useful way. Use the power of the internet to figure out how to better display [mystery_file.geojson](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcus/DART_Community_of_Practice/main/Prompts/Week07/mystery_file.geojson) and determine what it contains. If you get stuck, ask for help in the community discussion. 

**Social Warm-Up:** 
Share your favorite (or least favorite, or most common) error message. What do you do when it appears?

**Discussion Topic:** 
How were you able to open the file? What did it contain? If you got stuck at any point, how did you get past that? When you did open it, did you have any feelings of excitement, accomplishment, or joy?

### **When to post:**

While we are specifically asking you to post both your **social warm-up** and **discussion**, you can and should also post about other things!

Any time you get stuck or unstuck, consider posting about it in your Community of Practice. Your peers can empathize with you, help you get unstuck, benefit from what you have already learned, and celebrate your accomplishments with you!
