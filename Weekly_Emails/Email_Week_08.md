## **Welcome to Week 08 of the DART Program!**

Please take a moment to look at this weekâ€™s activities and set aside 2 or 3 hours in your week to work on the modules in your pathway and participate in your Community of Practice. 

This week is **Learning How to Learn Data Science Part 4: Processing the Emotional Side of Learning**.

### **Week 08 Community of Practice Activities:**

1. **Activity:** This weekâ€™s activity is to fill out the ðŸ”´[mid-program survey](link/to/survey)ðŸ”´. You can fill out the survey either before or after participating in this weekâ€™s discussion. 

2. **Social Warm-Up:** One method programmers use a lot, called "[rubber ducking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)," involves explaining what they are trying to do in plain language to a colleague, or if a colleague is not available, an inanimate object like a rubber duck. What qualities (personality/catchphrase/outfit/etc) would you want your rubber duck to reflect back to you? 

3. **Discussion Topic:** Reflect on the last few weeks' activities where you were repeatedly asked to try things you didnâ€™t know how to do. What emotions did you experience while figuring out how to open the mystery file? What balance (or lack of balance) did you find between the frustrations of getting stuck and the joys of working past that to ultimately open the mystery_file?  Do you have any advice for your community members, or for yourself in the future, when faced with similar challenges?

4. **Planning:** If you want to meet synchronously with members of your Community of Practice during the second half of the program, start to plan that now. What are good times to meet? 

**When to post:**

While we are specifically asking you to post both your social warm-up and discussion, you can and should also post about other things!

Any time you get stuck or unstuck, consider posting about it in your Community of Practice. Your peers can empathize with you, help you get unstuck, benefit from what you have already learned, and celebrate your accomplishments with you!

 Yours in Processing, 

The DART Team
