## **Welcome to Week 13 of the DART Program!**

Please take a moment to look at this week’s activities and set aside 2 or 3 hours in your week to work on the modules in your pathway and participate in your Community of Practice. 

This week is **Working with Data Part 2: Exploring Data**.

### **Week 13 Community of Practice Activities:**

1. **Activity:** Explore a public data set. You can use yours or someone else's from last week or find a new one, just don't use one from your own research that needs to be kept private because we are asking you to share it. See if you can figure out:
    - The column or variable names
    - The total number of records
    - The type of data: is it numerical? Geographical? Human language? A mix of several types?
    - If there is missing data, and if so, how much? 

2. **Social Warm-Up:** Share a story of missing or wrong data. It could be something minor, or a major problem like the California man who got the [license plate NULL ](https://www.wired.com/story/null-license-plate-landed-one-hacker-ticket-hell/) for his car.

3. **Discussion Topic:** Share what you learned about your dataset. What programs, languages, or tools did you use to explore it? Did you get stuck at any point? Were you able to figure out if there was missing data?

4. **Explore Further:** The questions we asked in this week’s activity are examples of metadata. Read this short article about [what metadata is and why it is important](https://data.research.cornell.edu/content/writing-metadata).

**When to post:**

While we are specifically asking you to post both your social warm-up and discussion, you can and should also post about other things!

Any time you get stuck or unstuck, consider posting about it in your Community of Practice. Your peers can empathize with you, help you get unstuck, benefit from what you have already learned, and celebrate your accomplishments with you!

 Yours in Exploration,
