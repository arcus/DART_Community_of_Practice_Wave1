## **Welcome to Week 06 of the DART Program!**

Please take a moment to look at this weekâ€™s activities and set aside 2 or 3 hours in your week to work on the modules in your pathway and participate in your Community of Practice. 

This week is **Learning How to Learn Data Science Part 2: Getting Stuck**.

### **Week 06 Community of Practice Activities:**

1. **Activity:** Attempt to open the [attached mystery file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcus/DART_Community_of_Practice/main/Prompts/Week06/mystery_file) and see what it contains. Does it open when you double click on it? Does right-clicking give you a list of possible applications to open it with? A basic text editor like NotePad (Microsoft) or TextEdit (Apple) will be able to open this file. What, if anything, can you learn from looking at the file? 

2. **Social Warm-Up:** Describe a time someone helped you get unstuck with your work.

3. **Discussion Topic:** Describe what feelings you have when you look at this file. Were you able to extract any information at all from it? What would you do if you had to tell someone what this file contains?



**When to post:**

While we are specifically asking you to post both your social warm-up and discussion, you can and should also post about other things!

Any time you get stuck or unstuck, consider posting about it in your Community of Practice. Your peers can empathize with you, help you get unstuck, benefit from what you have already learned, and celebrate your accomplishments with you!

 Yours in Frustration, 

The DART Team
