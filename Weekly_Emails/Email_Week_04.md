## **Welcome to Week 04 of the DART Program!**

Please take a moment to look at this week’s activities and set aside 2 or 3 hours in your week to work on the modules in your pathway and participate in your Community of Practice. 

This week is **Data Use Best Practices Part 3: NIH Data Sharing Rules**.

### **Week 04 Community of Practice Activities:**

#### **Activity:** 
How well do you know the new 2023 NIH data sharing rules? Read through the [FAQs](https://sharing.nih.gov/faqs#/data-management-and-sharing-policy.htm) to get an overview of what these new rules mean for you and your work. 

#### **Social Warm-Up:** 
Give a six word description of what you do. This could be silly or serious, and certainly won’t be long enough to get into much detail. Examples might be: 
<ul>
    <li> “Teach biomedical researchers to “data” better.” </li>
    <li> “Make mice sick, learn about cancer.” </li>
    <li> “Stain kids to see their organs.” </li>
</ul>

#### **Discussion Topic:** 
Pick something new you learned from the NIH data sharing rules and share it with your community of practice. Does your lab have a plan in place? Are there practices that will have to change to comply with these new policies?


### **When to post:**

While we are specifically asking you to post both your **social warm-up** and **discussion**, you can and should also post about other things!

Any time you get stuck or unstuck, consider posting about it in your Community of Practice. Your peers can empathize with you, help you get unstuck, benefit from what you have already learned, and celebrate your accomplishments with you!

 Yours in NIH Compliance, 

The DART Team
