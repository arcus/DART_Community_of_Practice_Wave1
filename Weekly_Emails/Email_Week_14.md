##### **Welcome to Week 14 of the DART Program!**

Please take a moment to look at this weekâ€™s activities and set aside 2 to 3 hours in your week to work on the modules in your pathway and participate in your Community of Practice. 

This week is **Working with Data Part 3: Visualizing Data**.

---

##### **Week 14 Community of Practice Activities:**

###### **Activity:** 
Try to create a visualization of some of the data in your dataset from last week.  While not everyone had R or Python in their pathway through the modules, if you did, try to create your visualization using one of those. You will most likely get error messages as you attempt to create a visualization. When you get an error message, share your error message with the group and see if anyone else got stuck at a similar spot.  

###### **Social Warm-Up:** 
What have you used in the past to create data visualizations? Are those visualizations easy to make and update? Do they look good and convey information effectively?

###### **Discussion Topic:** 
If you are able to create a visualization without encountering any error messages or difficulty running code, post your visualization and code and respond to others' posts about where they got stuck. What was challenging about creating, or attempting to create, your visualization?

###### **Explore Further:** 
Different members of your community of practice probably created their visualizations using different programming languages. No programming language is inherently better or worse than any other. Check out this talk by Gabriele S Hayden on the [cultural meaning of programming languages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCZRauYfqvg).

##### **When and where to post:**

Please respond to the social warm-up and discussion topic in a **comment** on this week's Community of Practice Activities post. This will keep the week's conversation in one place and make it easier interact with each other.

While we are specifically asking you to respond to these prompts, you can and should also post about other things!

Any time you get stuck or unstuck, consider posting about it in your Community of Practice. Your peers can empathize with you, help you get unstuck, benefit from what you have already learned, and celebrate your accomplishments with you!

 Yours in Visualization, 

The DART Team
