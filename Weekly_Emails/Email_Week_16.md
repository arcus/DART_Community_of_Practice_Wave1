## **Welcome to Week 16 of the DART Program!**

Please take a moment to look at this week's activities and set aside 2 or 3 hours in your week to work on the modules in your pathway and participate in your Community of Practice.

This week is **Wrapping Up Part 2: Beyond the DART Program**.

### **Week 16 Community of Practice Activities:**

1. **Activity:**  Add your recent skills acquisition to your CV.  If you didn't do the Post-Test Survey, do it now to get some sample language for your CV! You can also:
    - Share your materials with the community for constructive feedback
    - Update your GitHub profile and add README files to projects you have been working on. 

2. **Social Warm-Up:** Share your contact information and ways your community can follow you in the future e.g. [ORCID](https://orcid.org/), social media, etc.

3. **Discussion Topic:** Would you like to continue this community of practice in some way after the DART Program concludes? If so, now is the time to formulate a plan for ongoing communication.



**When to post:**

While we are specifically asking you to post both your social warm-up and discussion, you can and should also post about other things!

Any time you get stuck or unstuck, consider posting about it in your Community of Practice. Your peers can empathize with you, help you get unstuck, benefit from what you have already learned, and celebrate your accomplishments with you!

 Yours in Gratitude, 

The DART Team
