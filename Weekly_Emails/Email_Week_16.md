**Welcome to Week 16 of the DART Program!**

Please take a moment to look at this weekâ€™s activities and set aside 2 to 3 hours in your week to work on the modules in your pathway and participate in your Community of Practice. 

This week is **Wrapping Up Part 2: Beyond the DART Program**.

**Week 16 Community of Practice Activities:**

**Activity:** 
Add your recent skills acquisition to your CV.  If you didn't do the ðŸ”´Post-Test SurveyðŸ”´, do it now to get some sample language for your CV! You can also:
<ul>
    <li> Share your materials with the community for constructive feedback, and </li>
    <li> Update your GitHub profile and add README files to projects you have been working on.</li>
</ul> 

**Social Warm-Up:** 
Share your contact information and ways your community can follow you in the future e.g. [ORCID](https://orcid.org/), social media, etc.

**Discussion Topic:** 
Would you like to continue this community of practice in some way after the DART Program concludes? If so, now is the time to formulate a plan for ongoing communication.

## Connecting with DART:

In addition to staying in contact with your Community of Practice, you can also always reach out directly to us at dart@chop.edu. We would love to hear from you, especially if you are finding things you learned in the program particularly useful or relevant in the future.

Now that you are successful alumni of the DART Program, we want to give you a look behind the scenes: 
- Somewhat hidden on the [programâ€™s website](https://arcus.github.io/education_modules/) is a complete [list of all educational modules](https://arcus.github.io/education_modules/list_of_modules) we have created. You are welcome to try out any modules you find interesting, including those that were not on your assigned pathway.
- Both the program website and the modules themselves are maintained as a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/arcus/education_modules#education-modules) that you are welcome to explore, and even contribute to if that is something that interests you.

## Recruiting for Future Waves of Learners:

If you know of others who might be interested in participating in the DART program in the future, please send them to our interest form: https://redcap.link/dart-interest. 

While you can also direct them to the program website, let them know that accessing the modules will render them ineligible for participation as a research subject. 

## Our Deepest Gratitude:

We are so thankful for the time and effort you have put into this learning experience over the past 16 weeks and hope that you have found it to be a useful and rewarding experience.

 Yours in Gratitude, 

The DART Team
