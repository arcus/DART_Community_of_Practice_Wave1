## **Welcome to Week 01 of the DART Program!**

Please take a moment to look at this week's activities and set aside 2 or 3 hours in your week to work on the modules in your pathway and participate in your Community of Practice.

This week is **Introduction Part 1: Welcome to DART**.

### Week 01 Community of Practice Activities:

**Activity:** Log into [Thinkific](https://dart-program.thinkific.com/) and explore what you find there. Make sure you can do the following two things which are necessary for full participation in the DART program:
1.  Locate your pathway of learning modules and try out the first module on your pathway.
2. Locate your Community of Practice’s PeerBoard and [read the community guidelines](https://dart-program.thinkific.com/pages/communities-of-practice?path=post--1501091728). This is where you will be having discussions with your community of practice and sharing your responses to the social warm-ups. 

**Social Warm-Up:** Introduce yourself in your community’s PeerBoard. Who are you and why did you sign up for the DART program?

**Discussion Topic:**  Find a module in your pathway that you are particularly excited about and share why it is exciting. Note that not everyone in your community is on the same pathway, so you might be excited about a module that someone else doesn't have assigned. **Post your own answer on PeerBoard and respond to someone else’s post.**

**Planning:** If you want to meet synchronously with members of your Community of Practice, start to plan that now. What are good times to meet? 

**When to post:**

While we are specifically asking you to post both your social warm-up and discussion, you can and should also post about other things!

Any time you get stuck or unstuck, consider posting about it in your Community of Practice. Your peers can empathize with you, help you get unstuck, benefit from what you have already learned, and celebrate your accomplishments with you!
