## **Welcome to Week 01 of the DART Program!**

Please take a moment to look at this week‚Äôs activities and set aside 2 to 3 hours in your week to work on the modules in your pathway and participate in your Community of Practice. 

**If you were unable to attend an orientation session** earlier today, you can watch üî¥**this recording**üî¥ to see what you missed. Like we mentioned in the meeting, this first week is all about getting settled into the Thinkific platform and building the habits and relationships that will propel you through the program.

## Help Getting Started on the Thinkific Platform:

Please make sure that you can log into Thinkific. We will be holding drop-in times to help with any log-in issues you are having throughout this week. You can drop in to this Microsoft Teams room to get help üî¥**times and link here**üî¥.

Being able to access the Thinkific platform is essential to your participation in the program so please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out with any issues you have. 

## Weekly Structure

Each week you will be receiving an email which will contain the week‚Äôs Community of Practice Activities. Some weeks will have additional optional opportunities, but every week you will be provided with:
1. A brief reading or activity
2. A fun social warm-up question
3. A topic to discuss with your Community of Practice
This week is **Introduction Part 1: Welcome to DART**.

### **Week 01 Community of Practice Activities:**

#### **Activity:** 
Log into [Thinkific](https://dart-program.thinkific.com/) and explore what you find there. Make sure you can do the following two things which are necessary for full participation in the DART program:
<ol>
<li> Locate your pathway of learning modules and try out the first module on your pathway.</li>
<li> Locate your Community of Practice‚Äôs PeerBoard and read the [community guidelines](https://dart-program.thinkific.com/pages/communities-of-practice?path=post--1501091728). This is where you will be having discussions with your community of practice and sharing your responses to the social warm-ups.
</li>
</ol> 

#### **Social Warm-Up:** 
Introduce yourself in your community‚Äôs PeerBoard. Who are you and why did you sign up for the DART program?

#### **Discussion Topic:** 
Find a module in your pathway that you are particularly excited about and share why it is exciting. Note that not everyone in your community is on the same pathway, so you might be excited about a module that someone else doesn't have assigned. **Post your own answer on PeerBoard and respond to someone else‚Äôs post.**

#### **Planning:** 
If you want to meet synchronously with members of your Community of Practice, start to plan that now. What are good times to meet? 

## Giving and Receiving Support

One of the most important aspects of being in a Community of Practice is that every community member can both give and receive support. A request for support doesn‚Äôt have to be a detailed question, it can be as simple as ‚ÄúI keep getting this error message and have no idea what to do now. Anyone else facing this?‚Äù Similarly, supporting others can be as simple as responding that you got the same error message and don‚Äôt know how to get past it.

For the first few weeks of this program, the DART team will be checking in on your posts occasionally to help point you in the right direction, but the majority of support you receive will come from within your community!

Any time you get stuck or unstuck, consider posting about it in your Community of Practice. Your peers can empathize with you, help you get unstuck, benefit from what you have already learned, and celebrate your accomplishments with you!

We can‚Äôt wait to see what you are able to accomplish within your Data Science Community of Practice. 

 Yours in Data, 

The DART Team
