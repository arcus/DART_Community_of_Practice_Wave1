##### **Welcome to Week 2 of the DART Program!**

Please take a moment to look at this weekâ€™s activities and set aside 2 to 3 hours in your week to work on the modules in your pathway and participate in your Community of Practice. 

This week is **Data Use Best Practices Part 1: FAIR Data**.

---

##### **Week 2 Community of Practice Activities:**

###### **Activity:** 
What makes data FAIR? Take a look at this [discussion of FAIR data practices](http://www.fosteropenscience.eu/learning/assessing-the-fairness-of-data) and take the quiz at the bottom.  

###### **Social Warm-Up:** 
Is it "the data is" or "the data are," i.e. is the word data singular or plural? And does your belief match the way the words naturally come out of your mouth in conversation?

###### **Discussion Topic:** 
Share a way in which you have benefited by working with FAIR data, or a time in which you would have benefited had a data set followed the rules of FAIR. Have others experienced similar situations?

###### **Explore Further:**
For a much more in-depth discussion of FAIR data, check out the [FAIR Data 101](https://au-research.github.io/FAIR-data-101-training/) course offered by the [Australian Research Data Commons](https://ardc.edu.au).

##### **When and Where to Post:**

Please respond to the social warm-up and discussion topic in a **comment** on this week's Community of Practice Activities post. This will keep the week's conversation in one place and make it easier interact with each other.

While we are specifically asking you to respond to these prompts, you can and should also post about other things!

Any time you get stuck or unstuck, consider posting about it in your Community of Practice. Your peers can empathize with you, help you get unstuck, benefit from what you have already learned, and celebrate your accomplishments with you!

 Yours in FAIR Data, 

The DART Team
