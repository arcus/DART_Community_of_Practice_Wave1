## Giving and Receiving Support

One of the most important aspects of being in a Community of Practice is that every community member can both give and receive support. A request for support doesn’t have to be a detailed question, it can be as simple as “I keep getting this error message and have no idea what to do now. Anyone else facing this?” Similarly, supporting others can be as simple as responding that you got the same error message and don’t know how to get past it.

For the first few weeks of this program, the DART team will be checking in on your posts occasionally to help point you in the right direction, but the majority of support you receive will come from within your community!

Any time you get stuck or unstuck, consider posting about it in your Community of Practice. Your peers can empathize with you, help you get unstuck, benefit from what you have already learned, and celebrate your accomplishments with you!

We can’t wait to see what you are able to accomplish within your Data Science Community of Practice.
