**If you were unable to attend an orientation session** earlier today, you can watch ðŸ”´**this recording**ðŸ”´ to see what you missed. Like we mentioned in the meeting, this first week is all about getting settled into the Thinkific platform and building the habits and relationships that will propel you through the program.

## Help Getting Started on the Thinkific Platform:

Please make sure that you can log into Thinkific. We will be holding drop-in times to help with any log-in issues you are having throughout this week. You can drop in to this Microsoft Teams room to get help ðŸ”´**times and link here**ðŸ”´.

Being able to access the Thinkific platform is essential to your participation in the program so please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out with any issues you have. 

## Weekly Structure

Each week you will be receiving an email which will contain the weekâ€™s Community of Practice Activities. Some weeks will have additional optional opportunities, but every week you will be provided with:
1. A brief reading or activity
2. A fun social warm-up question
3. A topic to discuss with your Community of Practice
