In addition to this email, you should be receiving  an email with all of the details from today's orientation sessions. **If you were unable to attend an orientation session** please watch the recording in that email to see what you missed. Like we mentioned in the meeting, this first week is all about getting settled into the Thinkific platform and building the habits and relationships that will propel you through the program.

**Help Getting Started on the Thinkific Platform:**

Please make sure that you can log into Thinkific. We will be holding drop-in times to help with any log-in issues you are having throughout this week. The times and links to join those meetings are also in the accompanying email.

Being able to access the Thinkific platform is essential to your participation in the program so please don’t hesitate to reach out with any issues you have.

1. A brief reading or activity
2. A fun social warm-up question
3. A topic to discuss with your Community of Practice
