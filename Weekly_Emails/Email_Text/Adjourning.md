## Connecting with DART:

In addition to staying in contact with your Community of Practice, you can also always reach out directly to us at dart@chop.edu. We would love to hear from you, especially if you are finding things you learned in the program particularly useful or relevant in the future.

Now that you are successful alumni of the DART Program, we want to give you a look behind the scenes: 
- Somewhat hidden on the [programâ€™s website](https://arcus.github.io/education_modules/) is a complete [list of all educational modules](https://arcus.github.io/education_modules/list_of_modules) we have created. You are welcome to try out any modules you find interesting, including those that were not on your assigned pathway.
- Both the program website and the modules themselves are maintained as a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/arcus/education_modules#education-modules) that you are welcome to explore, and even contribute to if that is something that interests you.

## Recruiting for Future Waves of Learners:

If you know of others who might be interested in participating in the DART program in the future, please send them to our interest form: https://redcap.link/dart-interest. 

While you can also direct them to the program website, let them know that accessing the modules will render them ineligible for participation as a research subject. 

## Our Deepest Gratitude:

We are so thankful for the time and effort you have put into this learning experience over the past 16 weeks and hope that you have found it to be a useful and rewarding experience.
