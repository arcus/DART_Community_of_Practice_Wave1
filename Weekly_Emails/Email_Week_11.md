## **Welcome to Week 11 of the DART Program!**

Please take a moment to look at this week’s activities and set aside 2 or 3 hours in your week to work on the modules in your pathway and participate in your Community of Practice. 

This week is **Version Control Part 3: Open Source Projects**.

### **Week 11 Community of Practice Activities:**

#### **Activity:** 
A project is **open source** if all of the code and files used to make it are publicly available and are free from most intellectual property restrictions.  In other words, you can change and reuse open source code in your own project without getting special permission. There are a great many open source projects on GitHub, some maintained by large groups of collaborators. Use [GitHub’s search capabilities](https://github.com/search) - you can search by topic, author, or project name if you happen to know it - to find a repository that is interesting to you.  Read its README file to learn more about it and explore the files it contains. 

#### **Social Warm-Up:** 
What is a technical term in your field that sounds like something different (or confusing or weird) to people outside of your subfield or community? For example GitHub users talk about "forking" a repository, which means making a copy of it that they can then use and modify however they like.

#### **Discussion Topic:** 
Share a link to the GitHub repository (or **repo**) you found interesting and give a little information about what it contains. Some questions to consider answering include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
    <li> Does it have a license stating that it is open source? What restrictions does it have on its use? </li>
    <li> Does it have code you have used before, or are interested in using in the future?  </li>
    <li> Does it have many maintainers, or just a couple (or one)? </li>
    <li> When was it last updated? Are people actively working on it? </li>
</ul>


### **When to post:**

While we are specifically asking you to post both your social warm-up and discussion, you can and should also post about other things!

Any time you get stuck or unstuck, consider posting about it in your Community of Practice. Your peers can empathize with you, help you get unstuck, benefit from what you have already learned, and celebrate your accomplishments with you!

 Yours in Open Source, 

The DART Team
