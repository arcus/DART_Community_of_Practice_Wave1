**Welcome to Week 5 of the DART Program!**

Please take a moment to look at this weekâ€™s activities and set aside 2 to 3 hours in your week to work on the modules in your pathway and participate in your Community of Practice. 

This week is **Learning How to Learn Data Science Part 1: Getting Help and Support**.

**Week 5 Community of Practice Activities:**

**Activity:** 
It is extremely common to come across words and acronyms that are brand new to you when learning or practicing data science. Do a web search for something you have come across in a module or in your work that is new to you. If you don't have one handy, try JSON. We are intentionally not giving you any context about "JSON." 

**Social Warm-Up:** 
What webpage cheat sheets do you keep coming back to? Or do you have any phrases or commands that you do a web search on every time you need to use them?

**Discussion Topic:** 
There is a lot of information on the internet and web searches can be a very effective way to learn. However different sites and platforms have different tones and expectations. Stack Exchange, for example, has abundant information and a very active community of users answering questions, but can also be an unfriendly place. Think about the search results you got in the activity when discussing the following questions:
<ul>
    <li> What types of answers were most understandable and useful to you? </li>
    <li> Do you have any instructions or guidelines for how to answer programming questions kindly and constructively? </li>
    <li> What style of response makes you feel most comfortable asking your own questions? </li>
</ul>

**Explore Further:** 
Read this article on Medium about [how to ask for programming help in public forums](https://medium.com/the-self-taught-programmer/as-a-new-programmer-asking-for-help-is-intimidating-5188a0f62ab9). The author is making an effort to be warm and welcoming to new programmers while providing useful advice. Do you find they achieved that goal?

**When to post:**

While we are specifically asking you to post both your **social warm-up** and **discussion**, you can and should also post about other things!

Any time you get stuck or unstuck, consider posting about it in your Community of Practice. Your peers can empathize with you, help you get unstuck, benefit from what you have already learned, and celebrate your accomplishments with you!

 Yours in Confusion, 

The DART Team
