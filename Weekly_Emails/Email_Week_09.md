## **Welcome to Week 09 of the DART Program!**

Please take a moment to look at this week's activities and set aside 2 or 3 hours in your week to work on the modules in your pathway and participate in your Community of Practice.

This week is **Version Control Part 1: The Problem of Version Control**.

### **Week 09 Community of Practice Activities:**

1. **Activity:** Read the article [Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159v2/) by Jenny Bryan. While there may be some sections that don’t apply to you directly (for example if you don’t use R), the overall message is extremely important. 

2. **Social Warm-Up:** Share the "best" bad file name you have come across (or perhaps used yourself). These might be files like 
    - `probably_important3.doc`, 
    - `final_submission_actually_final.pdf`, 
    - `Untitled3523.jpg`, etc.

3. **Discussion Topic:** How do you keep track of changes in your files over time? What works well, and what problems have you encountered?



**When to post:**

While we are specifically asking you to post both your social warm-up and discussion, you can and should also post about other things!

Any time you get stuck or unstuck, consider posting about it in your Community of Practice. Your peers can empathize with you, help you get unstuck, benefit from what you have already learned, and celebrate your accomplishments with you!

 Yours in Version Control, 

The DART Team
