##### **Welcome to Week 3 of the DART Program!**

Please take a moment to look at this week’s activities and set aside 2 to 3 hours in your week to work on the modules in your pathway and participate in your Community of Practice. 

This week is **Data Use Best Practices Part 2: Reproducibility**.

---

##### **Week 3 Community of Practice Activities:**

###### **Activity:** 
Take the [PLOS reproducibility assessment](https://plos.org/reproducibility-assessment/) to determine how reproducible your research is. Watch this [short video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=66oNv_DJuPc) (under 5 minutes) about the frustrations that result when data is not managed with reproducibility in mind. You may have already seen this video in DART's module on reproducibility. 

###### **Social Warm-Up:** 
Find and post a cartoon about data. You might already have a favorite, or you can search the internet for “data cartoons.” Many of the DART team’s favorites are by Randall Munroe of [xkcd.com](xkcd.com).

###### **Discussion Topic:** 
What did you learn about how reproducible your research is? Are there things you want to start implementing or things that you have already implemented to make your research reproducible? See what others have already done and ask for advice.

###### **Explore Further:** 
Learn about the Center for Open Science’s [Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology](https://www.cos.io/rpcb).

##### **When and Where to Post:**

Please respond to the social warm-up and discussion topic in a **comment** on this week's Community of Practice Activities post. This will keep the week's conversation in one place and make it easier interact with each other.

While we are specifically asking you to respond to these prompts, you can and should also post about other things!

Any time you get stuck or unstuck, consider posting about it in your Community of Practice. Your peers can empathize with you, help you get unstuck, benefit from what you have already learned, and celebrate your accomplishments with you!

 Yours in Reproducibility, 

The DART Team
