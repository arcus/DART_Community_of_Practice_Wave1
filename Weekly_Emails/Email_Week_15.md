##### **When and Where to Post:**

Please respond to the social warm-up and discussion topic in a **comment** on this week's Community of Practice Activities post. This will keep the week's conversation in one place and make it easier interact with each other.

While we are specifically asking you to respond to these prompts, you can and should also post about other things!

Any time you get stuck or unstuck, consider posting about it in your Community of Practice. Your peers can empathize with you, help you get unstuck, benefit from what you have already learned, and celebrate your accomplishments with you!

 Yours in Data, Always, 

The DART Team
