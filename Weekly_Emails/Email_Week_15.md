## **Welcome to Week 15 of the DART Program!**

Please take a moment to look at this weekâ€™s activities and set aside 2 or 3 hours in your week to work on the modules in your pathway and participate in your Community of Practice. 

This week is **Wrapping Up Part 1: Reflecting on the DART Program**.

### **Week 15 Community of Practice Activities:**

1. **Activity:** Take the ðŸ”´[Post-Test Survey](link/to/survey/here)ðŸ”´. 

2. **Social Warm-Up:** Find and post a cartoon that speaks to your experience with the program or with coding so far.

3. **Discussion Topic:** Reflect on your last 15 weeks as a community. What activities, discussions, or modules were most helpful to you? Have you changed anything about how you do your work over the course of this program? Or how you think about data?



**When to post:**

While we are specifically asking you to post both your social warm-up and discussion, you can and should also post about other things!

Any time you get stuck or unstuck, consider posting about it in your Community of Practice. Your peers can empathize with you, help you get unstuck, benefit from what you have already learned, and celebrate your accomplishments with you!

 Yours in Data, Always, 

The DART Team
