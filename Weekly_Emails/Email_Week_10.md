##### **Welcome to Week 10 of the DART Program!**

Please take a moment to look at this week’s activities and set aside 2 to 3 hours in your week to work on the modules in your pathway and participate in your Community of Practice. 

This week is **Version Control Part 2: Introduction to GitHub**.

##### **Week 10 Community of Practice Activities:**

###### **Activity:** 
If you don’t already have one, create a GitHub account at [github.com](github.com). This can be a place for you to put some of your public work as part of your public portfolio. 

###### **Social Warm-Up:** 
What is the silliest/weirdest/best user name you have had or seen that you are willing to share? (Keep it work-appropriate, please.)

###### **Discussion Topic:** 
Share your GitHub handle with other members of your community of practice. If you have a pre-existing account, tell your community about what you have been using it for, but we expect that most of them will be empty because you just created them this week.

##### **When and Where to Post:**

Please respond to the social warm-up and discussion topic in a **comment** on this week's Community of Practice Activities post. This will keep the week's conversation in one place and make it easier interact with each other.

While we are specifically asking you to respond to these prompts, you can and should also post about other things!

Any time you get stuck or unstuck, consider posting about it in your Community of Practice. Your peers can empathize with you, help you get unstuck, benefit from what you have already learned, and celebrate your accomplishments with you!

 Yours in GitHub, 

The DART Team
